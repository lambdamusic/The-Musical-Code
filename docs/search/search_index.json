(modulo beat 4) 0)\n          (play dls 60 60 3))\n      (callback (*metro* (+ beat (* 1/2 1/4))) 'test (+ beat 1/4))))\n\n(test (*metro* 'get-beat 4))\n</code></pre> <p>Another way of doing this is by using case. Same approach, but probably faster to code, as it lets you specify 'multiple beats' very easily:</p> <pre><code>(define test2\n   (lambda (beat)\n      (case (modulo beat 4)\n            ((0)\n             (play dls 60 60 3))\n            ((2 5/2)\n             (play dls 67 60 1/2)))\n      (callback (*metro* (+ beat (* 1/2 1/4))) 'test2 (+ beat 1/4))))\n\n(test2 (*metro* 'get-beat 4))\n</code></pre> <p>Still quite a few parenthesis though... which, especially when playing live, might mean more chances to mess up! So when I saw Ben's video I realized that a macro usable to facilitate the creation of case/modulo expressions would be quite useful.. Here is how it can be done:</p> <pre><code>(define-macro (if-mod x y args)\n   `(for-each (lambda (step)\n                 (if (equal?

It is designed for situations which require low-level systems style programming. Two primary examples are audio signal processing and opengl programming - both of which require the production of highly efficient code. While attempting to achieve runtime efficiency the ICR also tries to maintain Impromptu's love of all things dynamic and is designed to coexist with the rest of Impromptu's infrastructure (Scheme, Objective-C, AudioUnits etc..).</p> <p>The new compiler seems to be introducing some pretty foundamental improvements:</p> <p>It is important to state from the outset that the new Impromptu compiler is NOT a scheme compiler. It is really its own language. This language looks like scheme (sexpr's and alike) but is in many ways semantically closer to C (a nice functional version of C :-). This is because the ICR is designed for purposes that are not suitable for the standard scheme interpreted environment. Low level tasks that require efficient processing - such as audio signal processing, graphics programming, or general numerical programming.</p> <p>Unlike Scheme the Impromptu compiler is statically typed. You may not always see the static typing but it is always there in the background. The reason that you won't always see the typing is that the compiler includes a type-inferencer that attempts to guess at your types based on static analysis of your code. Sometimes this works great, sometimes it doesn't. When things fail, as they surely will, you are able to explicitly specify types to the compiler.</p> <p>A big thanks to Andrew Sorensen for keeping up (and free) this great work!</p>","tags":["impromptu"]},{"location":"impromptu/2011-01-29-opening-a-finders-window-from-impromptu-alas-how-to-use-the-applescript-bridge/","title":"2011-01-29: Opening a Finder's window from Impromptu (alas how to use the applescript bridge..)","text":"<p>Imagine you've got a bunch of audio samples you want to load up while livecoding with Impromptu but you can't remember exactly their names - it'd be handy to be able to open up the corresponding Finder window directly from scheme, without too much clicking around.

It helps understanding the significance of the 'reaper time' setting in Impromptu, which I often playing around with without really getting it...

That is why audio programs do not send the audio signals they generate directly to the hardware, but write them to a short buffer in memory instead, whose contents are in turn being sent to the actual hardware. </p> <p>This concept allows the program to bridge short irregularities in the stream calculation and thus be more resistant to processing peaks. Of course, this \u201csafety net\u201d comes at a price\u2013the buffering causes a delay, known as latency, between the triggering of a note and the actual sound. This delay gets longer with increas- ing buffer sizes. Hence, it\u2019s vital to tune the buffer size in order to find a good compromise\u00a0between latency and playback reliability. The optimal value depends on such diverse factors as your CPU, memory and hard disk access times, your audio hardware and drivers, and your operating system environment. </p> <p>In order to find the optimal buffer size for your system, we recommend that you begin by setting the Latency slider described in the previous section to a healthy middle value between 384 and 512 samples, then gradually decrease the value during your normal work. When you begin to notice drop-outs, increase the buffer again by a small amount. Generally, it\u2019s a good idea to have as few other applications as possible running in the back- ground when working with audio software. Also, if you can\u2019t get below a certain buffer size without getting drop-outs, consult the documentation of your audio hardware to find out whether you can access it via an alternate driver architecture, as some architectures allow more efficient low-level access to the hardware than others.</p>","tags":["impromptu","latency","reaper","settings"]},{"location":"impromptu/2011-03-29-an-alternative-to-the-play-macro-iplay-and-with-instrument/","title":"2011-03-29: An alternative to the 'play' macro: 'iplay' and 'with-instrument'","text":"<p>The other day I was thinking: when I use the play macro in Impromptu  (video tutorial), in my head it's already obvious what's the virtual instrument I want to play. So why do I have to specify that all the time? Wouldn't it be more natural just being able to say, for example, get this instrument and now play this and that note with it...</p> <p>Let me clarify this with an example. Let's set up the standard Apple's DLS-synth audiounit and the metronome:</p> <pre><code>(au:clear-graph)\n(define dls     (au:make-node \"aumu\" \"dls \" \"appl\"))\n(au:connect-node dls 0 *au:output-node* 0)\n(au:update-graph)\n(au:print-graph)\n(define *metro* (make-metro 100))\n</code></pre> <p>Now imagine that we want to play some (dumb) melody with Apple's DLS.

Now we can modify the simple loop defined above like this:</p> <pre><code>(define the-usual-play-modified\n   (lambda (beat) \n      (let ((my-inst dls))\n         (iplay 60 90 1)\n         (iplay 64 90 1))\n      (play 1/2 dls 72 90 1)\n      (play 3/2 dls 67 90 1)\n      (callback (*metro* (+ beat (\\* 1/2 2))) 'the-usual-play-modified (+ beat 2))))\n\n(the-usual-play-modified (*metro* 'get-beat 4))\n</code></pre> <p>If you run that, you'll see that this loop sounds exactly the same as the previous one, although the first two play calls are now iplay macro calls. The whole thing works because we introduced a local variable my-inst and bound that to the dls audio instrument (created at the beginning). Notice that the new macro iplay knows nothing about what instrument is playing: it's just using blindly the my-inst variable, under the assumption that we've associated it to a valid audio instrument.</p>","tags":["impromptu","macro","play"]},{"location":"impromptu/2011-03-29-an-alternative-to-the-play-macro-iplay-and-with-instrument/#some-more-syntactic-sugar","title":"Some more syntactic sugar","text":"<p>The only hassle now is that each time we want to use iplay we are forced to use the (let ((my-inst dls)).. form.

In the second case instead the first argument is assumed to be an offset value (while the others remain unchanged).</p> <p>The original play macro can take another argument too: the channel (or midi port).

Long and convoluted functions are a giant source of errors especially when you're a bit tense</li> <li>use 'paste' templates. Stuff like the pb:cb function that comes by default with Impromptu. At the beginning I thought it wouldn't look too good, cause you've gotta show that you're coding the whole thing from scratch. But actually, when you're livecoding time is very very precious and what you want to focus on is sound, primarily (well at least this is what I like to do). It's also important to remember that many other environments for live performance are much much higher level than Impromptu - meaning that it's quicker to emit sounds or musical structures and change their properties... so let's make sure we're not comparing apple and oranges here!</li> <li>make variations often. Even if they look stupid to you, change something, add another melody, double the drumkit, stuff like that. The audience is more interested in new audio-visual things happening that in seeing you code a Bach's prelude.</li> <li>exercise a lot. I initially felt weird about this, mainly because playing with Impromptu means coding, and when I code I usually take my time and think. But livecoding transforms the coding practice into a musical performance. Which means that you don't have time to think, things should just come out automatically and sound good. Only then you can take the freedom of 'jamming' without a plan. I play guitar, and that's exactly how it works there... I must have forgotten about it. When playing a song I can't lose time trying to remember how to lay out the fingers on the neck, that has to happen automatically.</li> </ul> <p>That's it for now - I'll touch base again about this when the next live coding performance will happen!

But I've collected quite a few useful resources in the process, and those I can certainly share!</p> <p>So in what follows I've put together a list of learning resources about Scheme that I found useful.. First off, two links that might be useful in all situations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Little Scheme, an online interpreter that you can use for testing things out while you're on holidays</p> </li> <li> <p>Schemers.org, semi-official website containing news and lots of links to other resources</p> </li> </ul> <p>Now, why don't we start with the definition offered by the self-regulating wikipedia collective intelligence? Here we go:</p> <p>Scheme is one of the two main dialects of the programming language Lisp. Unlike Common Lisp, the other main dialect, Scheme follows a minimalist design philosophy specifying a small standard core with powerful tools for language extension. Its compactness and elegance have made it popular with educators, language designers, programmers, implementors, and hobbyists, and this diverse appeal is seen as both a strength and, because of the diversity of its constituencies and the wide divergence between implementations, one of its weaknesses</p> <p>If this blurb hasn't made you proud of learning such a slick language, you'll surely find more interesting ideas in what follows. I divided up the list in two sections, generic learning materials about scheme, and tutorials about specific topics (for now, only macros are included). ----------------------------------</p>","tags":["books","impromptu","learning","scheme"]},{"location":"miscellaneous/2010-08-10-learning-resources-about-scheme/#1-learning-resources-about-scheme","title":"1. Learning Resources About Scheme:","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Scheme for Common Lispers, article</p> <p>The Scheme dialect of Lisp was created in 1975 by Guy Steele and Gerry Sussman to explore ideas in programming-language semantics. They showed that a powerful language can be made ``not by piling feature on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary''. Scheme pioneered lexical scope in Lisp, first-class continuations, and tail recursion, and more recently added an advanced macro system. It's the best-known Lisp dialect after Common Lisp (which it influenced). This note summarizes the differences from CL that might slow down a CL programmer trying to read a Scheme program; people without a CL background, or wanting to write programs of their own, should see the references.</p> </li> <li> <p>the Schematics Scheme Cookbook</p> <p>The Schematics Scheme Cookbook is a collaborative effort to produce documentation and recipes for using Scheme for common tasks. See the BookIntroduction for more information on the Cookbook's goals, and the important ContributorAgreement statement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Harvey, Wright, Simply Scheme: Introducing Computer Science, 1999 MIT press [a classic]</p> <p>Symbolic programming is one aspect of the reason why we like to teach computer science using Scheme instead of a more traditional language. More generally, Lisp (and therefore Scheme) was designed to support what we've called the radical view of computer science. In this view, computer science is about tools for expressing ideas. Symbolic programming allows the computer to express ideas; other aspects of Lisp's design help the programmer express ideas conveniently. Sometimes that goal comes in conflict with the conservative computer scientist's goal of protection against errors.</p> </li> <li> <p>Felleisen, Findler, Flatt, Krishnamurthi, How to Design Programs An Introduction to Computing and Programming, MIT 2001</p> <p>[..] programming is more than just a vocational skill. Indeed, good programming is a fun activity, a creative outlet, and a way to express abstract ideas in a tangible form. And designing programs teaches a variety of skills that are important in all kinds of professions: critical reading, analytical thinking, creative synthesis, and attention to detail. We therefore believe that the study of program design deserves the same central role in general education as mathematics and English. Or, put more succinctly, everyone should learn how to design programs. On one hand, program design teaches the same analytical skills as mathematics. But, unlike mathematics, working with programs is an active approach to learning. Interacting with software provides immediate feedback and thus leads to exploration, experimentation, and self-evaluation. Furthermore, designing programs produces useful and fun things, which vastly increases the sense of accomplishment when compared to drill exercises in mathematics. On the other hand, program design teaches the same analytical reading and writing skills as English. Even the smallest programming tasks are formulated as word problems. Without critical reading skills, a student cannot design programs that match the specification. Conversely, good program design methods force a student to articulate thoughts about programs in proper English.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dybvig, The Scheme Programming Language, 2003MIT press</p> <p>This book is intended to provide an introduction to the Scheme programming language but not an introduction to programming in general. The reader is expected to have had some experience programming and to be familiar with terms commonly associated with computers and programming languages. The author recommends that readers unfamiliar with Scheme or Lisp also read The Little Schemer [see below]to become familiar with the concepts of list processing and recursion. Readers new to programming should begin with an introductory text on programming.</p> </li> <li> <p>Nils M Holm, \"Sketchy LISP\" [you can download the book here Update 08/12: this book has become 'Sketchy Scheme' and is now for-sale here]</p> <p>Sketchy LISP is a step-by-step introduction to functional programming in Scheme. It covers various aspects of the language including data types, conditional evaluation, list processing, lexical scoping, closures, recursion, dynamic typing, etc. By means of numerous examples of varying complexity, it takes the reader on an entertaining and informative tour through the language. The Scheme language achieves what only few languages have managed before: to bring fun back to programming. Its simple syntax, clean semantics, and powerful functions open the door to a fresh perspective on program design. Programming in Scheme is fun, and this book is an attempt to share some of that fun.</p> </li> <li> <p>Friedman and Felleisen, The Little Schemer, 1996 MIT press</p> <p>The goal of this book is to teach the reader to think recursively. Our first task, therefore, is to decide which language to use to communicate this concept. There are three obvious choices: a natural language, such as English; formal mathematics; or a programming language. Natural languages are ambiguous, imprecise, and sometimes awkwardly verbose. These are all virtues for general communication, but something of a drawback for communicating concisely as precise a concept as the power of recursion. The language of mathematics is the opposite of natural language: it can express powerful formal ideas with only a few symbols. We could, for example, describe the entire technical content of this book in less than a page of mathematics, but the reader who understands that page has little need for this book. For most people, formal mathematics is not very intuitive. The marriage of technology and mathematics presents us with a third, almost ideal choice: a programming language. Programming languages are perhaps the best way to convey the concept of recursion. They share with mathematics the ability to give a formal meaning to a set of symbols. But unlike mathematics, programming languages can be directly experienced---you can take the programs in this book and try them, observe their behavior, modify them, and experience the effect of your modifications.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Weiner Lectures Archives [various videos, but not complete lectures unfortunately]</p> <p>The goal of this project is to make knowledge of computer science easily available not only to the students at Berkeley, but also to the entire community. For several years, faculty members have been videotaping lectures in CS large lower division courses, mainly as an aid to students with time conflicts that prevent them from attending lectures. By hosting an archive storing all CS lectures that were recorded, we hope the computing knowledge that has been gathered can be easily shared. As a teaching aid, a 'greatest hits' lecture will also be compiled for each course covering all major topics addressed in the corresponding class. The best parts of many different past lectures will be linked together and presented along with slides to make this greatest hits lecture. This lecture should represent the best teaching abilities in the lower division CS lectures and should be a valuable resource in the computer community for basic CS knowledge.

I admire anyone who can do that, but it does seem pretty much a sophisticated parlor trick unless the music resulting can stand on its own. The question becomes, were you to hear the piece without observing the live coding performance, would it stand up, or is the quality of the piece augmented by the way in which it was composed? Is a decent painting painted by someone who paints blindfolded something I would rather see than an excellent painting by someone who paints in a conventional fashion? Cause unless the live coder can spin something up that I would enjoy listening to on my portable media player, I feel like music takes a back seat to the musician, which is a truly peculiar something.

As a result I tend to see it as some sort of advanced music-making tool. However, interestingly enough, in order to make that tool match my music taste and composition style I had to become an expert at programming the livecoding environment. While doing that, I sort of lost the closure to the 'instrument', which is something you'd have all the time if you play a piano or a guitar. With no closure, you end up in the role of 'music programmer', worrying about mathematical structures and time recursions rather than notes and feelings.</p> <p>It's a cyclical process, actually. You gain competency with some programming pattern that lets you express your musical ideas quickly and efficiently. Then you think of different ideas, but you can't put them into code easily, so you've got to step back, abandon the musical dimension temporarily, and hack some new programming structures. Which makes me think: maybe that's what's so cool about it. Livecoding environments are malleable meta-instruments that let you create (software) music instruments.</p> <p>So the music - the end result - is definitely part of it. But the process, the how in the music creation business is also what we have in focus here.
