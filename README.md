# The Musical Code

This repository contains experimental musical code/algorithms using the amazing [Extempore](https://extemporelang.github.io/) programming language (as well as it precursor [Impromptu](http://impromptu.moso.com.au)).

## Listen to the code

This repo has a counterpart [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCanqSICbxzRNEZGMlu8qfyw), where you can watch/listen the works in execution.

## Algorithmic composition? 

> Algorithmic composition is the technique of using algorithms to create music -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_composition)

Yes, that's a rather unconvential way of making music. But it's also fun and (in its own way) spectacularly unique. You can also do that *live* too, in front of an audience sitting or dancing: it goes by the name of  [livecoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding).  


## Extempore Extensions

The [Extempore Extensions](https://github.com/lambdamusic/extempore-extensions) repo contains a bunch of (mainly MIDI) scheme extensions that I developed in order to create Extempore musical algorithms more efficiently and more naturally.
