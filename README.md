## What is this repo

This repository contains experimental musical algorithms using the amazing [Extempore](https://extemporelang.github.io/) programming language (as well as it precursor [Impromptu](http://impromptu.moso.com.au)).

This repo has a counterpart [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCanqSICbxzRNEZGMlu8qfyw), where you can watch/listen the works in execution. 

### Algorithmic composition? 

> Algorithmic composition is the technique of using algorithms to create music -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_composition)

Yes, that's rather excentric. But it's also a lof of fun. You can also do that live, in front of an audience sitting or dancing, and it's called [livecoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding).  


## Structure

* the `works` folder is where the source code of the musical compositions can be found
* the `utils` folder contains various extempore utility function used in the compositions
