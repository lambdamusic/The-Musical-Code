Went to the [SouthBank Centre](http://gigs.southbankcentre.co.uk/2011/04/02/ether-2011-trailer-for-2001-a-space-odyssey-live-with-philharmonia-orchestra/) the other night, to see Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey Live with Philharmonia Orchestra. Very very nice, almost moving even if I've seen the movie a dozen times already!

> Following a sell-out success in June 2010, Southbank Centre presents Stanley Kubrick’s seminal film [2001: A Space Odyssey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)) with live music. Conducted by [André de Ridder](http://www.andrederidder.com/biog.html), the enormous forces of [Philharmonia Orchestra and Philharmonia Voices](http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/) join together to perform the film’s extraordinary soundtrack, as live accompaniment to a screening in Royal Festival Hall. Long recognised as one of the greatest science fiction films of all time, 2001 – A Space Odyssey is celebrated for its technological realism, its innovative Oscar-winning special effects and a [bold use of music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(score)). The film brought worldwide fame to both Richard Strauss’ Also Sprach Zarathustra and the music of Gyorgy Ligeti; it also created one of cinema’s most memorable images as a spaceship floats serenely through space to the strains of Johann Strauss’ Blue Danube waltz.

Here's an excerpt from last night's performance:
