[Jamendo](http://www.jamendo.com/en/) is a new model for artists to promote, publish, and be paid for their music. I've used this new service for a couple of hours only but I already like it a lot.

.. can it be because the [Kryos Project](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/8325/) are already in it?

## Creative commons

> On jamendo, the artists distribute their music under Creative Commons licenses. In a nutshell, they allow you to download, remix and share their music freely. It's a "Some rights reserved" agreement, perfectly suited for the new century. These new rules allow jamendo to use the powerful new means of digital distribution like Peer-to-Peer networks such as BitTorrent or eMule to legally distribute albums at near-zero cost.

Jamendo is the only platform that joins together :  

> A legal framework protecting the artists (thanks to the Creative Commons licenses).  
> Free, simple and quick access to the music, for everyone.  
> The use of the lastest Peer-to-Peer technologies  
> The possibility of making direct donations to the artists.  
> An adaptive music recommendation system based on iRATE to help listeners discover new artists based on their tastes and on other criterias such as their location.
