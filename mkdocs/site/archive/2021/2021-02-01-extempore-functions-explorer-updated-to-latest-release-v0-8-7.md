# About the explorer app

The Extempore functions explorer is a little Django webapp I built [a while ago](http://www.michelepasin.org/projects/impromptudocs/) in order to make it easier to browse (and learn about) the Extempore programming language. 

The [source code](https://github.com/lambdamusic/xtm-docs) is available on Github.
