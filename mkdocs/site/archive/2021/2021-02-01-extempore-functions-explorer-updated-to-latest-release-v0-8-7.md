The [Extempore functions explorer](https://extempore.michelepasin.org/) has been updated with the latest version of the Extempore programming language: [v0.8.9](https://github.com/digego/extempore/tree/v0.8.9)

## About the explorer

The Extempore functions explorer is a little Django webapp I built [a while ago](http://www.michelepasin.org/projects/impromptudocs/) in order to make it easier to browse (and learn about) the Extempore programming language. 

> Try it out at: [https://extempore.michelepasin.org/](https://extempore.michelepasin.org/)

The [source code](https://github.com/lambdamusic/xtm-docs) is available on Github.
