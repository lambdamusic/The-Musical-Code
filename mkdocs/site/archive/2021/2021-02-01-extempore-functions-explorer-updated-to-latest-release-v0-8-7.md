The Extempore functions explorer has been updated with the latest version of the Extempore programming language: [v0.8.9](https://github.com/digego/extempore/tree/v0.8.9)

> Try it out at: [https://extempore.michelepasin.org/](https://extempore.michelepasin.org/)

The Extempore functions explorer is a little webapp I built [a while ago](http://www.michelepasin.org/projects/impromptudocs/) in order to make it easier to browse (and learn about) the Extempore programming language. The [source code](https://github.com/lambdamusic/xtm-docs) is available on Github.

### What is Extempore?

[Extempore](https://extemporelang.github.io/) is a programming language and runtime environment designed by [Andrew Sorensen](https://twitter.com/digego?lang=en) to support livecoding and cyberphysical programming, where a human programmer operates as an active agent in the world.
