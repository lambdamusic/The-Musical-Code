The [prog rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock) album I've worked on [years ago](http://www.michelepasin.org/sounds/?k=kryos) with the band Kryos Project is now available also on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1uCLwvX24IFPp9g9SVoHqh) (and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08SKXH1BW/?tag=distrokid06-20) too).

Why? Well it just feels good to be able to open up Spotify and _listen to your own music._ This is stuff we've made almost 20 years ago (!) but it still feels kinda relevant. Fresh. Well.. you know what I mean.

### Cool. How do I get my band too on Spotify? 

It was surprisingly easy actually, if you don't mind spending a little money (around 20 dollars per year).

I used [Distrokid](https://distrokid.com/) to handle the distribution to all major services. It's a bit fiddly to work with and the overall UX is rather barebones, but it does what is supposed to for a pretty damn honest price!
