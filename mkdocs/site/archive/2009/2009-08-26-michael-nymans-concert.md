I went to the BBC proms last night, to see [Michael Nyman](http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Nyman)'s performance. It's been a delightful hour, such **inspiring and intriguing melodies**, really worth it! I really love the way [minimalistic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalist_music) ideas crop up all the time, but always with a dense and emotional touch. And the **Royal Albert Hall** is an outstanding venue too..

> [After more than 40 years](http://www.michaelnyman.com/info/news/article/nymans-music-honoured-at-bbc-proms-2009) in the vanguard of British music as a composer, pianist, librettist and musicologist, Michael Nyman has been **honoured with his first BBC Proms concert**.
> 
> The concert, part of the 115th Proms season, will take place at the Albert Hall, London on Aug 25 and features the World Premiere of a new piece entitled The Musicologist Scores commissioned by the BBC and music from Draughtman’s Contract, Celan Songs and Memorial with guest soloist Anu Komsi in a programme that will commemorate two key dates in musical history - the 350th anniversary of Purcell’s birth and the 250th anniversary of the death of Handel.
> 
> Both were key influences on Nyman, who edited scores by the two composers as a PhD student under Thurston Dart in the 1960s \[at Kings College!!\].
> 
> “A BBC Prom is obviously something that any composer hopes will happen one day,’’ Nyman says. ‘‘The concert self-evidently commemorates the two giants of English baroque music. But coincidentally it also celebrates my own relationship with the work of the two composers,’’ Nyman says.
> 
> “A concert combining the music I have composed directly their work - the Purcell-based ‘The Draughtsman’s Contract’ and ‘The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover’ and the Handel-based ‘The Musicologist Scores’ seems entirely appropriate.’‘

This is the **list of songs played** last night: The Draughtsman’s Contract – selection 23’ The Musicologist Scores c20’ BBC commission: world premiere Six Celan Songs – Blume; Psalm 10’ The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover – Memorial 12’
