Hey ya - [new livecoding stuff from me on Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com/7762642). It's a song I've been working on recently, called **Kali**.

## Export options?

Unfortunately I still haven't figured what the best export options for the original (1.6 Gigs) movie file are, so that I could create an export that looks less blurry on Vimeo.. but slowly I'm getting there! The sound is ok though, so hopefully you'll enjoy!
