Aviary's [ROC Music Creator](http://aviary.com/tools/music-creator) is a **free** **online** music **sequencing** tool written using Adobe's AIR framework.

I just tried it, not really what I need right now but I can't say it's not a good product: easy to use (you can make music loops and ringtones pretty fast), attractive interface, nice sounds (more than 50 instruments including pianos, guitars, percussions), export capabilities (download mp3s with one click), voice recording, sharing functionalities to work with others.
