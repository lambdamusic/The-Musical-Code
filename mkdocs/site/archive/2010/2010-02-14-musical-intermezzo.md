Some songs, I'll never forget. They are still giving me the shivers as they did when I was a kid.

I'll let you guess the titles!

Rolling down the highway, going to a show
Stopping on the by ways, playing rock n roll 
Getting robbed, getting stoned 
Getting beat up, broken boned 
Getting had, getting took I tell you folks, it's harder than it looks

It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock n roll 
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock n roll 
If you think it's easy doing one night stands 
Try playing in a rock n roll band 
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock n roll 

Hotel motel, make you wanna cry 
Baby's on the hard sell, know the reason why 
Getting old, getting grey 
Getting ripped off, underpaid 
Getting sold, second hand 
That's how it goes playing in a band 

It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock n roll 
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock n roll 
If you wanna be a star of stage and screen Look out it's rough and mean 
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock n roll 
Gotta tell ya It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock n roll 
It's a long way, it's a long way, it's a long way

If you're havin' trouble with your high school head
He's givin' you the blues 
You wanna graduate but not in 'is bed 
Here's what you gotta do - 
Pick up the phone 
I'm always home 
Call me any time 
Just ring 36 24 36 hey I lead a life of crime 

Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap 
Dirty Deeds and they're Done Dirt Cheap 

You got problems in your life of love 
You got a broken heart 
(She's) He's double dealin' with your best friend 
That's when the teardrops start - fella 
Pick up the phone 
I'm here alone 
Or make a social call 
Come right in 
Forget about him 
We'll have ourselves a ball 

Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap 
Dirty Deeds and they're Done Dirt Cheap 

If you got a lady and you want her gone 
But you ain't got the guts 
She keeps naggin' at you night and day 
Enough to drive you nuts 
Pick up the phone 
Leave her alone 
It's time you made a stand 
For a fee I'm happy to be Your back door man 

Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap 
Dirty Deeds and they're Done Dirt Cheap 

Concrete shoes, cyanide, TNT 
Done Dirt Cheap contracts, necties, high voltage 
Done Dirt Cheap dirty deeds done dirt cheap 
```
