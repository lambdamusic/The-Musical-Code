The purpose of [Pico Play](http://www.kronenberg.org/picoplay/) is very simple: don't get in the way. You want to listen to music without having to load any heavy application (iTunes included) - but still being able to use all the songs in your iTunes playlist... this is the piece of software you need. And it's **free**!
