First off - check out how cool is the little [game](http://balldroppings.com/) below. It's been implemented with [processing.js](http://processingjs.org/), a port of the famous [processing](http://processing.org/) library that works in your browser only through javascript (the original processing is java-based).

What is processing?

> The Processing language was created by [Ben Fry](http://benfry.com/) and [Casey Reas](http://reas.com/). It evolved from ideas explored in the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the MIT Media Lab and was originally intended to be used in a Java run-time environment. In the Summer of 2008, [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/) ( inventor of jQuery ), ported the 2D context of Processing to Javascript for use in web pages.

Mmm how about processing.js then?

> Processing.js is an **open programming language** for people who want to program images, animation, and interactions for the web **without using Flash or Java** applets. Processing.js uses Javascript to draw shapes and manipulate images on the [HTML5](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html) Canvas element. The code is light-weight, simple to learn and makes an ideal tool for visualizing data, creating user-interfaces and developing web-based games.
> 
> Processing.js is explicitly developed for browsers that support the HTML5 <Canvas> element. Processing.js runs in FireFox, Safari, Opera and Chrome but will **not** be **supported** in **Internet Explorer**.

**There's more**: some [people](http://luckybite.com/) in London created [iProcessing](http://luckybite.com/iprocessing/), which lets you develop iPhone apps without touching objC (at least, that's what they say). Seems a bit of a revolution to me...

> **iProcessing is an open programming framework to help people develop native iPhone applications using the Processing language.** It is an integration of the Processing.js library and a Javascript application framework for iPhone. The iProcessing [download](http://iprocessing.googlecode.com/files/iProcessing-0004.zip)consists of a set of example XCode projects that demonstrate many of the Basic Examples from the [Processing](http://processing.org/learning/basics) web site (originally written by Casey Reas and Ben Fry unless otherwise stated) as well a number that demonstrate the **use of various iPhone features such as multitouch, accelerometer, orientation, location, sound play/record, app state saving and so on**.
