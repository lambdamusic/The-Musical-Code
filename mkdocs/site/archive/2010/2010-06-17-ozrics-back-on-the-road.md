Good news, **mythical Ozric Tentacles** \[[official website](http://www.ozrics.com/)\] are going to have a number of gigs in the UK in the coming fall. All the dates are available at [allgigs.co.uk](http://www.allgigs.co.uk/view/artist/1924/Ozric_Tentacles.html) . They'll play in London on Thu 28th Oct 2010 at the Islington Academy, it's **only 25 quid**, get in touch if you want to join me!

> Ozric Tentacles (commonly known as the Ozrics) are an instrumental rock band from Somerset, England, whose music can loosely be described as psychedelic or space rock. Formed in 1984, the band has released 28 albums as of 2009, and become a cottage industry selling over a million albums worldwide despite never having major label backing. \[[wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozric_Tentacles)\]

This is 'Saucers', for the 'Strangeitude' album:

I saw them live a coupe of times already, never got disappointed with the performance..
