[Nanoloop](http://www.nanoloop.com/) is a **mobile music software** that provides all functionality you need to create nice electronic music. With its clear, minimalistic interface it plays almost like a game while still allowing for complex musical structures as well as sheer noise.

> Nanoloop for iPhone combines **sequencer**, synthesizer and sampler in one package. Features include:
> 
> \- Six channels, each can be synth or sampler - Fast and easy to use stepsequencer - Synthesizer with envelope, filter, LFO and other parameters - Sample external audio or nanoloop's own sound output - Song editor with loop function - Save function - Works on 1st gen iPod touch and 2.2 software - Send and receive projects via e-mail, using the iPhone's / iPod's e-mail program

I found out about it via [creativeApplications.net](http://www.creativeapplications.net/iphone/nanoloop-iphone-sound/), and I loved the simplicity of the interface straightaway!!
