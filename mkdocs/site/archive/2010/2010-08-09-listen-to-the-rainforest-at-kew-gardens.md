If you happen to be going to London's [Kew Gardens](http://www.kew.org/visit-kew-gardens/index.htm), make sure you don't miss this nice sound installation by [Chris Watson](http://www.chriswatson.net/). The installation is on till September 5th and it's called [Whispering in the Leaves](http://www.whisperingintheleaves.org/):

> Whispering in the Leaves features two sound pieces – **Dawn** and **Dusk** – composed by Chris from memory using his extensive archive of on-location recordings in Central and South American **rainforests**.
> 
> Designed specifically for the Palm House, Whispering in the Leaves is the audio equivalent of 3D cinema. Visitors will be immersed in a **dynamic, spatial soundscape of primate calls and birdsong**, backed with a shimmering wall of insect sounds. Some of the species heard are currently unknown to humans. Visitors will experience the heard but never seen.
> 
> Diffused through **80 speakers**, the two compositions will be transmitted at **hourly** **intervals** throughout the day - Dawn in the morning and Dusk in the afternoon. Each lasts for **15-20 minute durations** – the approximate time it takes for the transitions between darkness and daylight in the dense tropical vegetation.

The website makes available some of the nature recordings too.
