I've been experimenting a bit with picking random notes from a scale using various voices simultaneously, so to create interesting sounds textures... and what came out is maybe a bit too random at the beginning, but getting more interesting towards the end imho ...

Oh yeah, the song is called **'My Misty Morning'**.
