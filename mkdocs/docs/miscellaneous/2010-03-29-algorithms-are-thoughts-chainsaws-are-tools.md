A short movie about [livecoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOPLAP#Organizations_and_Institutions), Andrew Sorensen (creator of [Impromptu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impromptu_(programming_environment))), [TOPLAP](http://toplap.org/index.php/Main_Page) and other related stuff. If you're not familiar with this stuff, I'd say it's the **most pleasant introduction** to it available at the moment!

Thanks [Stepher Ramsay](http://vimeo.com/user1776782) for doing this!
