# Kontakt instruments

The default instruments are pretty good 

However if you open up any of mine in the `2.instruments` library, they go into DEMO mode 

![alt](../assets/images/kontakt1.png)

~~The correct way is to open them up in Live directly.~~

It used to be possible to import them using Sample. But from [Live 11](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001134410-Supported-sample-formats) it is not possible to do that anymore..


See: [Kontakt Player Demo Mode – Explained](https://bedroomproducersblog.com/2020/04/23/kontakt-demo-mode/#:~:text=Question%3A%20Why%20do%20I%20see,the%20full%20version%20of%20Kontakt.)

> The “demo mode” means that you can only use the library for fifteen minutes. After that, there will be no sound on the output, and you won’t be able to access the editing features

# Spitfire Audio

- [installation](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/getting-started-labs) 

How to reset: 

Had occasionally to reset everything cause I was getting errors with instruments not being found, even after reinstalling them as per [error 4](https://spitfireaudio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006357354)

1. [delete everything](https://spitfireaudio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403731679121-How-do-I-Uninstall-a-Spitfire-Library-)
2. install app and log in 
3. the libraries installed previously may still appear. So you have to 
	* click on the library icon, select the cog, click on 'reset', 'reset entire library'
	* optionally, then reinstall it

# Arturia Analog 4 Vs Analog 5

August 15, 2023: I have both of them installed 

> Analog Lab V (5) can play all Arturias sounds, including legacy sounds, if you have any.  
> Analog Lab 4 can't play the sounds from applications that's new in V-Collection 8. But perhaps you find the workflow and better for you, as things has changed from AL 4 to AL V.
