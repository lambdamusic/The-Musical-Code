Finally I managed to shrink down to a reasonable size and upload the video recording from our last [livecoding event at Kings College](http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/2010/01/10/livecoding-night-kings-college-coming-up/).

Hopefully the other people will be uploading theirs too some time soon .. Here's my piece titled *Untitled 12*:

## About livecoding

> Live coding is a new direction in electronic music and video, and is starting to get somewhere interesting. Live coders expose and rewire the innards of software while it generates improvised music and/or visuals. All code manipulation is projected for your pleasure. Live coding is inclusive and accessible to all. For more info see: http://toplap.org/
