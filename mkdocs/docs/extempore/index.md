    [Extempore](https://extemporelang.github.io/) is a programming language for musical livecoding and algorithmic composition. If you're new to Extempore, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=extempore+livecoding) has many videos that show it in action.


## Extempore Extensions

The [Extempore Extensions](https://github.com/lambdamusic/extempore-extensions) repo contains a bunch of (mainly MIDI) scheme extensions that I developed in order to create Extempore musical algorithms more efficiently and more naturally.
