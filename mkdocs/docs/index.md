# Welcome

This site and its related [Github repository](https://github.com/lambdamusic/The-Musical-Code) contain a collection of tutorials, lessons-learned and video performances on the topic of musical algorithmic composition. 

!!! question "Algorithmic composition?"

    "Algorithmic composition is the technique of using algorithms to create music" -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_composition)

    Admittedly, that's a rather unconventional way of making music. But it's also fun and spectacularly unique. 

    You can perform algorithmic composition *live* too, in front of an audience sitting or dancing: it goes by the name of  [livecoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding).  

    "Live coding is a new direction in electronic music and video, and is starting to get somewhere interesting. Live coders expose and rewire the innards of software while it generates improvised music and/or visuals. All code manipulation is projected for your pleasure. Live coding is inclusive and accessible to all." -- [toplap.org](http://toplap.org/)


## Video tutorials

The [videos](videos) section of this website include an index of all my compositions / experiments, as well as some accompanying ideas.

All of the videos live on the [Musical Code YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCanqSICbxzRNEZGMlu8qfyw). If you can't wait till my next livecoding ramblings, feel free to take a look and subscribe there.

## Who is this for? 

First and foremost, I would like to share the stuff I've learned on this topic with all `computer music enthusiasts` out there. I assume that you may take inspirations from my explorations, the same way I did from a zillion other sites out there...  

Secondly - and sometimes most importantly - this is really a bit like a personal collection of notes and tips about my learning journey in algorithmic composition. A personal knowledge base I routinely get back to since my memory often faults me!

!!! abstract "Gist"
    This is what I write to the future me who has forgotten how I did the stuff I want to do again.
