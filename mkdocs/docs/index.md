## Algorithmic composition? 

> Algorithmic composition is the technique of using algorithms to create music -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_composition)

Admittedly, that's a rather unconventional way of making music. But it's also fun and (in its own way) spectacularly unique. You can also do that *live* too, in front of an audience sitting or dancing: it goes by the name of  [livecoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding).  

> Live coding is a new direction in electronic music and video, and is starting to get somewhere interesting. Live coders expose and rewire the innards of software while it generates improvised music and/or visuals. All code manipulation is projected for your pleasure. Live coding is inclusive and accessible to all. -- [toplap.org](http://toplap.org/)
