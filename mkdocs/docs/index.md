# Welcome to the Livecoding tips website

This site and its related [Github repository](https://github.com/lambdamusic/The-Musical-Code) contain a collection of tutorials and lessons learned on the topic of livecoding and Extempore. 

!!! note "Note"
    [Extempore](https://extemporelang.github.io/) is a programming language for musical livecoding and algorithmic composition. If you're new to Extempore, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=extempore+livecoding) has many videos that show it in action.


## Algorithmic composition? 

> Algorithmic composition is the technique of using algorithms to create music -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_composition)

Admittedly, that's a rather unconventional way of making music. But it's also fun and (in its own way) spectacularly unique. You can also do that *live* too, in front of an audience sitting or dancing: it goes by the name of  [livecoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding).  


## Extempore Extensions

The [Extempore Extensions](https://github.com/lambdamusic/extempore-extensions) repo contains a bunch of (mainly MIDI) scheme extensions that I developed in order to create Extempore musical algorithms more efficiently and more naturally. 


## Video tutorials

This website has a counterpart [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCanqSICbxzRNEZGMlu8qfyw), where you can watch/listen the works in execution.
