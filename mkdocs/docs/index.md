# Welcome to the Musical Code website

This site and its related [Github repository](https://github.com/lambdamusic/The-Musical-Code) contain a collection of tutorials, lessons-learned and video compositions on the topic of livecoding and algorithmic composition.

## Who is this for? 

- `programmers`, `coders`, `computer music enthusiasts` who may take inspirations from my explorations, the same way I did from a zillion other sites out there
- Extempore and Impromptu users: these are the main two programming environment I've been using in my explorations
- `myself`: this is a bit like a personal knowledge base I routinely get back to since my memory faults me often


## Algorithmic composition? 

> Algorithmic composition is the technique of using algorithms to create music -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_composition)

Admittedly, that's a rather unconventional way of making music. But it's also fun and spectacularly unique (in its own way). 

### Livecoding

You can perform algorithmic composition *live* too, in front of an audience sitting or dancing: it goes by the name of  [livecoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding).  

> Live coding is a new direction in electronic music and video, and is starting to get somewhere interesting. Live coders expose and rewire the innards of software while it generates improvised music and/or visuals. All code manipulation is projected for your pleasure. Live coding is inclusive and accessible to all. -- [toplap.org](http://toplap.org/)

## Video tutorials

The `videos` section of this website include an index of all my compositions / experiments, as well as some accompanying ideas.

All of the videos live on the [Musical Code YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCanqSICbxzRNEZGMlu8qfyw), so feel free to take a look and subscribe there, if you can't wait till my next livecoding ramblings.
