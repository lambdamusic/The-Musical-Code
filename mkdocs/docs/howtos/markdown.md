# Markdown tips

In VSCode:

- Press ⌃Space (Trigger Suggest) while editing to see a list of suggested Markdown snippets
- Use ⇧⌘O to quickly jump to a header in the current file.
- Use ⌘T to search through headers across all Markdown files in the current workspace
- Path suggestions are automatically shown when you type / or can be manually invoked by using ⌃Space.
- You can Drag and drop a file from VS Code's Explorer or from your operating system into a Markdown editor. Start by dragging a file from VS Code's Explorer over your Markdown code and then hold down Shift to start dropping it into the file. 
- Previews: To switch between views, press ⇧⌘V in the editor. You can view the preview side-by-side (⌘K V) too
