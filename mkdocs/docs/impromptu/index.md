# About Impromptu

[Impromptu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impromptu_(programming_environment)) is a Mac OS X programming environment for live coding, created by Andrew Sorensen. Impromptu is built around the Scheme language, which is a member of the Lisp family of languages. 

Here is a classic piece made with Impromptu, titled **A Study in Keith**.

!!! warning "Legacy software"

    Impromptu was released in 2005 and was superseded by [Extempore](../extempore/index.md) around 2011. The source code of its core has been opened as the Extempore project.


The articles in this section are older than the rest of the site and have been mainly adapted from [another blog](https://www.michelepasin.org/words/index.html%3Ftag=impromptu&type=all.html).
