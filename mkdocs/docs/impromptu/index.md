# About Impromptu

!!! warning "Legacy software"

    Impromptu was released in 2005 and was superseded by [Extempore](../extempore/index.md) around 2011. The articles in this section were originally published [on another blog](https://www.michelepasin.org/words/index.html%3Ftag=impromptu&type=all.html) and have been archived here. 


[Impromptu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impromptu_(programming_environment)) is a Mac OS X programming environment for live coding, created by Andrew Sorensen. Impromptu is built around the Scheme language, which is a member of the Lisp family of languages. 

Here is a classic piece made with Impromptu, titled **A Study in Keith**.
