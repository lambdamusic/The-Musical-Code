Just ran into this interesting article by [Brian Eno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno). It struck me as quite a fair representation of what livecoders do most of the time, when they create (maybe I should say 'sculpt') musical structures that evolve in time, as part of their performance:

> It’s intuitive to think that anything complex has to be made by something more complex, but evolution theory says that complexity arises out of simplicity. That’s a bottom-up picture. I like that idea as a compositional idea, that **you can set in place certain conditions and let them grow. It makes composing more like gardening than architecture**

It's from [http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct05/articles/brianeno.htm](http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct05/articles/brianeno.htm).

Here is one of the songs from the album Eno is talking about in that article, [Another Day on Earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Day_on_Earth).
