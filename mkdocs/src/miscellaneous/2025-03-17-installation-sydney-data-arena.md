## About the installation

The installation happened on March 4th 2025 as part of the Digital Science Showcase within the [UTS DataArena](https://dataarena.net/).

The installation is titled **Australian Institution Co-authorship Collaboration Patterns**. The networks presented represent a connected graph of co-authored researchers affiliated to Australian institutions from 2018-2023. 

Each researcher has been colour coded by the scientific field code they are most associated with. Each researcher is depicted by a sphere, and given a size based on the number of publications produced.
