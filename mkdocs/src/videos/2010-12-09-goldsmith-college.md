## The Event

Thursday Club Xmas party \[ [event-site](http://toplap.org/uk/event/thursd/) | [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=131290450261616) | [flier](http://toplap.org/media/thursday.pdf) | [map](http://maps.google.co.uk/?ie=UTF8&ll=51.474597,-0.037993&spn=0.000433,0.000983&t=h&z=20) \]


**6:30pm sharp til 8:30pm, 2010/12/16** at [Goldsmith Digital Studios](http://www.gold.ac.uk/virtual-tours/bpb-terrace/)

Enjoy live coded music from some of the UKs finest algorithmic musicians, namely:

* **slub** - Slub celebrate a decade since they first got a whole room of people to dance to their code (at Amsterdam Paradiso), with a hard-edged set of abstract acid with extra breakdowns. \[ http://slub.org/ \] 
* **Wrongheaded** - Conducting an algorithmic seance, where a ouiji board control interface issues instructions from beyond the grave. Dimly lit but for the flickering of gas-driven projector screens, the protagonists will be appropriately moustachioed as they bring you ethereal sounds from the underworld. 
* **Thor Magnusson** - Shaking, self-modified beats with ixilang, from the co-founder of ixi audio. \[ http://www.ixi-audio.net/ \] 
* **Michele Pasin** - Audio/Visual temporal recursion with Impromptu. \[ http://www.michelepasin.org/ \] 
* **Forth + Yee-King** - South Bank Common Lisp + SuperCollider synchronised in percussive improv. \[ http://www.yeeking.net/ \]
