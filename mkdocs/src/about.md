# About


I am not a computer music professional. I actually [work](https://www.michelepasin.org/) in AI and research analytics. But music (of all kinds) has always been a driving force in my life.

## Why this site? 

So you may wonder why I'm writing about this.

First and foremost, I would like to share the stuff I've learned on this topic with all *computer music enthusiasts* out there. I assume that you may take inspirations from my explorations, the same way I did from a zillion other sites...  

Secondly - and sometimes most importantly - this a bit like a *personal* collection of notes and tips about my learning journey in algorithmic composition. A knowledge base I routinely get back to since my memory often faults me!

!!! abstract "Gist"
    This is what I write to the future me who has forgotten how I did the stuff I want to do again.
