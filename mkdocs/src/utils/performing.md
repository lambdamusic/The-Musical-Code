## Getting started with live performance

The trick is to have smth simple that you can progressively enhance. 

Eg add an octave, some random variation, then cosr etc..

Eventually the base structure is there. And you can take more time to build other stuff that requires more code.


## Printing code (for guiding performance) 

Recipe to export from VSCode:

1. Copy from VSCode. 
2. Open in TextMate. Pick the Scheme language syntax. 
3. Open print dialog: pick a font size and theme that suits. Ideally make it fit within one page. 
4. Print

PS on home printer, choose B/W printing.
