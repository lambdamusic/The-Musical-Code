!!! question "Algorithmic composition?"

    "Algorithmic composition is the technique of using algorithms to create music" -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_composition)

    "Live coding is a new direction in electronic music and video, and is starting to get somewhere interesting. Live coders expose and rewire the innards of software while it generates improvised music and/or visuals. All code manipulation is projected for your pleasure. Live coding is inclusive and accessible to all." -- [toplap.org](http://toplap.org/)
